# Omarchist

**A GUI app for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org). Powered by Tauri / Rust / Svelte.**

With respect to the TUI aesthetics of Omarchy, this app tries to add some visual aspects to the process of creating and editing themes for your Omarchy system.

If Omarchy is the "omakase" meal by a Michelin star chef, Omarchist is the gelato you grab after, on the way home.

yay -S omarchist-bin
