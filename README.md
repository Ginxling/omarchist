# Omarchist

**A GUI app for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org). Powered by Tauri / Rust / Svelte.**

Inspired by Omarchy's TUI aesthetics, this app enhances the theme creation and editing process with a more visual experience.

If Omarchy is the "omakase" meal by a Michelin star chef, Omarchist is the gelato you grab after, on the way home.

## Install

```bash
yay -S omarchist-bin
```

## Features

- **Theme Designer:** Visual editor for creating and editing Omarchy themes.

### Future plans:

- **Config Management:** Edit and generate configs for Waybar, Omarchy,...
